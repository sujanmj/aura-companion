# AURA delivery roadmap

AURA is currently a development preview, not a finished always-present companion.
The confirmed repository is https://github.com/sujanmj/aura-companion.

## Long-term companion target

The intended product is a present, personal companion: it can notice useful
context throughout the day, remember user-approved people, events and routines,
and speak naturally without requiring a wake phrase for every exchange. It may
help find recently seen objects, offer timely routine and medication reminders,
and contribute to a shared conversation when invited. This is an aspiration;
these capabilities are not implemented as a complete system today. Software milestones now proceed across Phases 2–12; Phase 2 hardware
acceptance remains open and is not a prerequisite for independent software work.

Always-present sensing must be distinguishable from recording. Audio and video
are processed only while the user has enabled the relevant sensor, with visible
status and an immediate pause control. Raw media is not retained by default;
local, user-reviewable summaries are the memory. Face/name memory is limited to
people the user enrolls with appropriate consent. A person AURA cannot identify
may trigger a configured visitor notice, but AURA must not invent their name or
identity. Activity and object observations carry uncertainty and can be corrected
or forgotten. Proactive speech respects quiet hours, interruption preferences,
and confidence thresholds. Online factual grounding is opt-in, must distinguish
verified information from uncertainty, and must not turn ambient conversation
into unrestricted external tool actions. Health signals and medication schedules
are separately opt-in; reminders are not proof that a dose was taken or a
substitute for professional care.

For every milestone: implement, run relevant automated tests, fix failures, commit,
push, and verify CI before continuing. CI success proves only the checks it ran.
Live provider, hardware, and multi-device behavior require separate acceptance
results. Never describe mocked speech/provider tests as live verification.

## Phase 1 — Preserve AURA and integrate its interface

Status: complete for the development preview.

- Preserve the existing SQLite schema, personality, feedback and Claude provider.
- Add the AURA interface and opt-in voice using appropriately attributed MIT code.
- Keep external actions disabled by default and approve individual MCP invocations.
- Verify authenticated conversation, persistence, backup, feedback and UI flows.

Evidence: integration branch through b2d1aa4; 18 local automated tests and Linux /
macOS CI run 39288627959 passed. Preview artifacts exist. This is not a stable
hardware release, and the branch has not yet been merged into main.

## Phase 2 — Reliable single-device runtime

Status: software reliability milestones implemented; hardware acceptance remains open.

- Completed: closed approval gates after cancellation; enforce approval deadlines;
  explicit kiosk auto-send consent; fail closed when the memory worker dies/stalls.
- Completed with CI: native startup, Pause, camera cleanup and delayed
  responses obey a single capture-session lifecycle; prevent speaking after Pause.
  Camera setup always closes its configuration transaction, even on failure.
  Evidence: 89a3894, Linux/macOS run 39290007322; native lifecycle tests include
  1,000 cancel/restart cycles. This is automated evidence, not a hardware test.
- Implemented: authenticated Setup/readiness diagnostics distinguish missing
  configuration, local fallback and configured-but-unverified providers.
- Implemented: denied macOS Speech Recognition, microphone, and camera
  permissions offer a direct Privacy Settings button for recovery.
- Implemented: during an explicitly started Mac ambient session, Apple Vision
  scene labels and a human-presence signal can be saved as derived summaries in
  the existing SQLite observation memory. The authenticated loopback endpoint
  accepts bounded labels only, stores no image/audio, and limits writes to one
  changed summary per minute. The Memory view already supports review/deletion.
  Unit and authenticated API tests pass, and the native helper builds. Hardware
  acceptance of this new persistence path remains outstanding.
- Implemented: the paired Mac helper checks the existing local check-in endpoint
  every five minutes while the AURA app is running, including when ambient
  camera and microphone capture are paused. Explicit reminder enables and
  check-in preferences remain the gates; quiet hours and daily delivery limits
  are enforced by local SQLite. Replies use local speech and do not invoke
  Claude or MCP actions. Local app-build, native-test, API, and Python checks
  pass; macOS and Ubuntu push/PR CI passed in runs 39613730506 and 39613739454.
  Live speaker acceptance remains outstanding.
